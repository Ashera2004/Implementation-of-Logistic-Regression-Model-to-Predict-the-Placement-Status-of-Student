# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Model-to-Predict-the-Placement-Status-of-Student

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Placement Status of Student.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**  
   - Import necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn).  
   - Load dataset and handle missing values.  
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical format.  

2. **Split Data**  
   - Separate features (X) and target variable (y).  
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80%-20%).  

3. **Train Logistic Regression Model**  
   - Import `LogisticRegression` from Scikit-learn.  
   - Train the model using `fit(X_train, y_train)`.  

4. **Make Predictions**  
   - Use `predict(X_test)` to predict placement status.  

5. **Evaluate Model Performance**  
   - Calculate accuracy using `accuracy_score()`.  
   - Use a confusion matrix and classification report for detailed analysis.
